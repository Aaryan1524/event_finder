If things are breaking for seemingly no reason, here are some things you may want to consider trying.
1. Make sure you have the latest changes in your working tree. You can do this by running `git pull` in your terminal.
2. Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can do this by running `npm install` in your terminal.
3. Make sure you have all the necessary environment variables set up. These must be in your `.env` file at the repository root. To get an updated `.env` file, contact @Aaryan1524 .
